# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

## Required Icons

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Guidelines

- Use the CarbonWise brand colors (green gradient)
- Include a recognizable carbon/sustainability symbol
- Ensure good visibility at small sizes
- Follow Chrome extension icon guidelines

## Temporary Solution

For development, you can use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files as placeholders.

The icons should visually represent:
- Carbon footprint tracking
- Environmental awareness
- Modern, clean design
- CarbonWise branding
